#we just need to extract the successive image frames from video
#find the absolute diff between frames.(I did that with absdiff function)
#now threshold it to the required value and get rectangles lengths using the threshold image.(we got the points or corners of the retangle with findContors function)
#now draw the rectangle on the frame and display it..
